  Before You Begin

  Create a new GitHub repo called python-challenge. Then, clone it to your computer.
  Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the        challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.
  Inside of each folder that you just created, add a new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
  Push the above changes to GitHub.
